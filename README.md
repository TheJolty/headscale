## Introduction

Headscale is an open-source implementation of the Tailscale coordination server. It allows you to create your own mesh VPN network, giving you the freedom to manage your private resources securely. This demo will guide you through deploying Headscale on AWS, providing a practical example of how to set up and connect to your private network.

## Features

- **Self-hosted VPN**: Control your own VPN server without relying on third-party services.
- **AWS Integration**: Leverage the power of AWS to deploy your Headscale server.
- **Private Resource Access**: Easily connect to your private resources over a secure network.
- **Simple Setup**: Follow straightforward steps to get your Headscale instance running.
- **Scalable**: Easily scale your deployment based on your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with Headscale, you will need an AWS account. If you don't have one, sign up for free. Once you have access to AWS, you can follow the instructions below to deploy Headscale.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of AWS services (EC2, Route 53, etc.)
- Familiarity with command-line tools

## Installation

To install Headscale, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/TheJolty/headscale/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate binary for your operating system and architecture.

### Step 1: Set Up AWS EC2 Instance

1. Log in to your AWS account.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click on "Launch Instance."
4. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that suits your needs (Ubuntu is a good choice).
5. Select an instance type (t2.micro is free-tier eligible).
6. Configure your instance details and security groups.

### Step 2: Install Headscale

Once your EC2 instance is running, connect to it using SSH. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
```

After connecting, you can download and install Headscale:

```bash
wget https://github.com/TheJolty/headscale/releases/latest/download/headscale-linux-amd64
chmod +x headscale-linux-amd64
sudo mv headscale-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/headscale
```

### Step 3: Configure Headscale

Create a configuration file for Headscale. You can do this by running:

```bash
headscale init
```

This will create a default configuration file that you can edit according to your needs.

## Usage

Once Headscale is installed and configured, you can start it with the following command:

```bash
headscale serve
```

Headscale will now be running on your EC2 instance, and you can access it via your browser or command line.

## Connecting to Private Resources

To connect to your private resources, you will need to set up DNS and routing. You can use Route 53 for DNS management and configure your security groups to allow traffic between your EC2 instance and your private resources.

### Step 1: Set Up Route 53

1. Go to the Route 53 dashboard in AWS.
2. Create a hosted zone for your domain.
3. Add A records pointing to your EC2 instance's public IP.

### Step 2: Configure Security Groups

Make sure your EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on the necessary ports. For Headscale, you typically need to allow UDP and TCP traffic on port 443.
